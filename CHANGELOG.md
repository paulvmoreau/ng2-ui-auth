- #### BREAKING CHANGES:
  - Using HttpClient instead of Http
  - Using HttpClient Interceptor instead of JwtHttp
  - In the `exchangeForToken` flow (when you want to exchange authorization code given by the authorization endpoint with your server's token) this library now sends a body that looks like this instead of a flat mesh of the oauth options, oauth result and user data:

```js
{
    "authorizationData": {
        //the same data sent to the auth endpoint
    },
    "oauthData": {
        //the data received from the oauth endpoint
    },
    "userData": {
        //additional data you've provided
    }
}
```

- You don't need a class for the options and several options were removed (mostly because you can't make requests while you intercept requests...):
  - `defaultHeaders` - No need, you can create your own interceptor.
  - `tryTokenRefreshIfUnauthorized`, `refreshBeforeExpiration`, `autoRefreshToken`, `refreshUrl` - Removed since can't refresh while intercepting (if you come up with a clever idea how please send a pull request / issue)
- changed the OauthOptions
  - removed `exchangeForToken` - was hard to use and nobody was using it
  - removed `responseParams` - was not in use
  - removed `scopePrefix` - you can just add it as the first param in `scope`
  - `scope` is only an array
  - No more `requiredUrlParams`/`optionalUrlParams` confusion! introducing `additionalUrlParams` - just add a param name, and value and it will be added to the request, if the value is `undefined` the param will not be added, if the value is `null` it will be added without a value, if the value is a function, it will run the function.

```typescript
export class MyAuthConfig extends CustomConfig {
    providers = {google: {clientId: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}};
}

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        HttpModule,
        Ng2UiAuthModule.getWithConfig(MyAuthConfig),
        ...
    ]
    ...
```

#### 3.2.5

- Added "refresh token" flow, if you configure 'autoRefreshToken' to true then if you call a webservice when the token expires this library automatically sends it to the server using 'refreshUrl' endpoint (can be set in config default = '/auth/refresh') first and then sets a new token if it receives it and tries to call the original request. (issue #41)
